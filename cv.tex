		  {\sl Teaching Assistant Volunteer} \hfill Spring and Fall 2008\\
		  Millikin University, Decatur, IL\\
		  Volunteer teaching assistant for four computer
                  science related courses.  Taught several class
                  periods, held review sessions, kept office hours
                  twice a week, and tutored students one-on-one.\\
